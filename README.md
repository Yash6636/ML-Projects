"Employee Attrition Prediction Project: A comprehensive machine learning project to predict employee attrition using a diverse dataset from Kaggle. The project encompasses data preprocessing (encoding, scaling), feature engineering (PCA, VIF analysis), model building (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.), and evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC). Advanced techniques like SMOTE were applied to address class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning was done via GridSearchCV. The project achieved high accuracy and provides valuable insights for human resources management."
